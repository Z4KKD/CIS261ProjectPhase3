# Employee Payroll Management System

This Python program helps manage employee payroll information by allowing users to input employee details such as name, dates worked, hours worked, hourly rate, and tax rate. The program then calculates the gross pay, income tax, and net pay for each employee and displays the information. Additionally, it provides functionality to view total statistics for all employees.
